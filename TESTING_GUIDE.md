# FlowScope Testing Guide

This guide will help you test FlowScope locally before deploying to Smithery.ai. The tests verify that all components are working correctly.

## 🧪 **Quick Test**

Run the automated test script:

```bash
node test-flowscope.js
```

This will test:
- ✅ Frontend build
- ✅ Server build  
- ✅ File structure
- ✅ Component functionality
- ✅ Hook implementation
- ✅ Package scripts

## 🚀 **Manual Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Test Frontend Only**

```bash
# Start frontend development server
npm run dev:frontend

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
# You should see:
# - Flow diagram with mock data
# - Live Monitoring panel (top-right)
# - Interactive nodes and edges
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Page loads without errors
- ✅ Flow diagram displays mock data
- ✅ Live Monitoring panel is visible
- ✅ Nodes are clickable and show details
- ✅ Search and filter controls work

### **Step 2: Test Server Components**

```bash
# Build server
cd server && npm run build

# Test server health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","connections":0}
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Server builds without errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ WebSocket server is configured

### **Step 3: Test Full Stack**

```bash
# Start both frontend and server
npm run dev

# This starts:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - Backend: http://localhost:3001
# - WebSocket: ws://localhost:3001
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Both servers start successfully
- ✅ Frontend connects to backend
- ✅ Live Monitoring panel shows connection status
- ✅ WebSocket connection is established

### **Step 4: Test Live Monitoring**

1. **Open FlowScope** in browser
2. **Click "Start Monitoring"** in Live Monitoring panel
3. **Create a test file** in your project:
   ```bash
   echo "// Test page" > src/pages/TestPage.tsx
   ```
4. **Watch for updates** in the flow diagram

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Monitoring starts successfully
- ✅ Connection status shows "Connected"
- ✅ File changes are detected (when MCP server is working)
- ✅ Flow updates in real-time

### **Step 5: Test WebSocket Communication**

```bash
# Test WebSocket connection
curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" \
  -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
  -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" \
  -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==" \
  http://localhost:3001/ws
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ WebSocket upgrade response
- ✅ Connection established

## 🔧 **Component-Specific Tests**

### **Test LiveMonitoringPanel Component**

```bash
# Check component structure
grep -n "useLiveFlow\|startMonitoring\|stopMonitoring" src/components/flow/LiveMonitoringPanel.tsx
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All required functions are imported
- ✅ Component renders without errors
- ✅ State management works correctly

### **Test useLiveFlow Hook**

```bash
# Check hook implementation
grep -n "WebSocket\|useState\|useEffect" src/hooks/useLiveFlow.ts
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ WebSocket connection logic
- ✅ State management for monitoring
- ✅ Error handling for connection issues

### **Test FlowPreview Component**

```bash
# Check flow visualization
grep -n "ReactFlow\|useFlowStore" src/components/flow/FlowPreview.tsx
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ React Flow integration
- ✅ State management with Zustand
- ✅ Node and edge rendering

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: Frontend Build Fails**

```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build:frontend

# Fix common issues:
# 1. Missing dependencies
npm install

# 2. TypeScript configuration
# Check tsconfig.json is valid

# 3. Import/export issues
# Check all imports are correct
```

### **Issue: Server Build Fails**

```bash
# Check server dependencies
cd server && npm install

# Check TypeScript configuration
cd server && npx tsc --noEmit

# Common fixes:
# 1. Add missing @types packages
# 2. Fix import/export syntax
# 3. Update tsconfig.json
```

### **Issue: WebSocket Connection Fails**

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Check WebSocket endpoint
# Browser console should show connection status

# Common fixes:
# 1. Ensure server is started
# 2. Check firewall settings
# 3. Verify WebSocket URL in frontend
```

### **Issue: Live Monitoring Not Working**

```bash
# Check MCP server status
# The MCP server needs additional setup

# For now, test with mock data:
# 1. Verify LiveMonitoringPanel renders
# 2. Check WebSocket connection status
# 3. Test UI interactions
```
